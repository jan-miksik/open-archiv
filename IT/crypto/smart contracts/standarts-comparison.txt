ERC721 vs ERC1155
From what I read ERC1155 seems more optimazed(gas efficency), on the other hand ERC721 looks like golden standard for non-fungible assets and ownership is more obvious. 
https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/129117/why-do-people-like-use-erc721-to-public-nft-instead-of-erc1155

Intendent collection should have

1) only non-fungible NFT tokens
2) Royalties with support for major marketplaces.
3) Be secure and tested
4) Limits for max supply and max nfts per address
5) Has set metadata onchain except image which is uploaded on IPFS
6) The price of mint is arbitrary, can be zero or more
7) option to change royalties receiver
