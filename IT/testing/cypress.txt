cypress Notes

env-cmd -f .env

- prefer on local server - performance, more posibilities. Can be also against deployed server
- We recommend that the vast majority of tests use stub data
-Don't use your UI to build up state! It's enormously slow, cumbersome, and unnecessary.
-Add data-* attributes to make it easier to target elements
-cy.contains()

-You rarely have to ever use const, let, or var in Cypress. If you're using them, you will want to do some refactoring.

-?Tests should always be able to be run independently from one another and still pass .

- it().only runs only this selected test
- it.skip() skip test
