blockchian
ipfs
Arweave 
the graph

they are usually slow and is hard to do anything else above scope of blockchain data

the more centralized part
RPC providers (alchemy, infura,)
hosting of backends include nodes (AWS, GCP, Azure, heroku ...)
hosting of FE and domains (cloudflare, domain providers)
centralized intermediators - ipfs providers (pinata, fleek, ) - cloudflare
internet providers
internet infrustucture?
dev inrustructure github, gitlab

numbers
around 8000 nodes
around 1mil validators
supply around 120mil ETH

concerns
70% of all nodes hosted are using a cloud provider
