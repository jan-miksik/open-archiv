- Cipher suite
Why is Diffie-Hellman prefered against RSA?
What is AES?

symetric cryptography - same key for encryption and decryption
Protocol - TLS 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, SSLv3, SSLv2
key exchange -ECDHE - eliptic curve diffie hellman ephemeral key exchange
Auth - RSA, ECDSA
Cipher - AES GCM/CBC, Camellia, DES, RC4, RC2 (encryption algorithms)
MAC - 

Key exchange - Auth - Cipher - MAC
