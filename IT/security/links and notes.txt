- Cipher suite

What is AES?

symetric cryptography - same key for encryption and decryption
Protocol - TLS 1.2, 1.1, 1.0, SSLv3, SSLv2
key exchange -ECDHE - eliptic curve diffie hellman ephemeral key exchange
Auth - RSA, ECDSA
Cipher - AES GCM/CBC, Camellia, DES, RC4, RC2 (encryption algorithms)
MAC - 

Key exchange - Auth - Cipher - MAC


- BIG IP
BIG IP is platform of HW and SW

LTM - local traffic manager
DNS/GTM - global traffic manager
APM - access policy manager (inspect device type, identity)
SWG - secure web gateway, filtering requests
ASM - aplication security manager (inspect application), layer 7 L7
AFM - advanced firewall manager, L3/L4 - layer 3 and 4,
AAM - aplication acceleration manager - optimization

BIG IQ - management of all this big IPs, silverline, f5Saas

NODE (serve) = IP
POOLS (server services) IP:PORT
SNATS secure NAT translation
