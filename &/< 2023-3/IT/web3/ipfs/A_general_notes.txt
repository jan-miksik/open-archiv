#fundemental principles of IPFS
1) Unique identification via content addressing (similar to Git, Ethereum and Bitcoin)
2) Content linking via directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)
3) Content discovery via distributed hash tables (DHTs)

IPLD (InterPlanetary Linked-Data)
NAT (Network Address Translation)
OSI Model (Open Systems Interconnection Model)

content identifier (CID) - contains codec and multihash
codec
multihash - has hash type and hash value

-same data have same hash
-There are two types of encryption in a network: transport-encryption and content-encryption. IPFS uses transport-encryption but not content encryption.


# Merkle DAG # 
directed - structure parent -> child
Acyclic Graphs - no loops in the graph
-used in git
-building the graph from the bottom to up *parents are created after children
-if something change in child every ancestors will change
-deduplication


# libp2p
libp2p is more focused on process addressing,
-libp2p breaks the OSI Model apart and allows applications to mix and match freely without being restricted to rigid conceptual models.


# Mutable File System (MFS)
-is a tool built into IPFS that lets you treat files like you normally would in a name-based filesystem -CRUD

- Content Addressing on the Decentralized Web
- Merkle DAGs: Structuring Data for the Distributed Web
- Introduction to libp2p
- Mutable File System
- Regular Files API

++
-with content addressing is much harder to fake some data
-verifable
-trustless

B] vlastni ipfs node

1. vytvořit jednoduchout databázi např. todo list ... CRUD, vue app, připojení na existující node
2. vlastní IPFS node
3.

#NAT - Network address translation
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation
method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets while they are in transit across a traffic routing device.
