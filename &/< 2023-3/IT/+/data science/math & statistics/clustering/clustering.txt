cluster
  `data group, goal is maximaze similatiry within a cluster and maximaze the disssimilarity between clusters`

examples 
  market segmentation
  image segmentation

cluster analysis 
  `identify patern`

supervised learning
  `labelled data, inputs, correct values for outputs`

unsupervised learning
  `unlabelled data,`

euclidean distance
  `direct connection between A and B`

centroid
  `point in center between points`

K-means clustering
  `K for number of clusters`
  1. choose number of clusters
  2. specify the cluster seeds
  3. assign each point to a centroid
  4. adjust the centroids
  - repeat 3 and 4 until done

Elbow method
  `find point where linear graph is "elbowed" - break`

WCSS
  `within-cluster sum of squares` - `minimaze WCSS makes perfect clustering solution`

Pros
  simple to undestand
  fast to cluster
  widely available
  easy to implement
  always yields result

Cons + `remedies` 
  we nedd to pick K `the elbow method`
  sensitive to initalization  `k-means++`
  sensitive to outliers `remove outliers`
  produces spherical solution `standatization`

Standardization

Types of analysis
  exploratory
    `search for patterns,`
  confirmatory
    `confirm a hypothesis, validate previous research, explain a phenomenon`


Types of Hierarchical clustering
  agglomerative `clustering from bottom up`
    dendrogram
      pros `shows all the possible linkages between clusters, better data understanding, no need to preset the number of clusters (like with k-means), many methods to perform hierarchical clustering(Ward!)`
      cons  `scalibility`
  divisive `top down`
