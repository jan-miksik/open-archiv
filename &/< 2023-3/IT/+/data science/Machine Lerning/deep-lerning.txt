Xavier initialization / Glorot initialization
  `Xavier Glorot`
  uniform Xavier initialization
    draw each weight, w, from a random uniform distribution 
    in [-x,x] for x = odmocnina(6/(inputs + outputs))
  normal Xavier initialization
    draw each weight, w, from a normal distribution with a mean of 0, and a standard deviation Ïƒ = odmocnina(2/(inputs + outputs))
