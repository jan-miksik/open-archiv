Notes
Sharing my usual proces when facing error or problem

error
-the error message is quite clear and just need to fix it
-trying to carefuly read what is wirten in the error message
-copy the message of error and search for it
-go through the path from A, B ... to Z and maybe more preciasly locate the error - adding logs along the path
-again read the error message
-trying better formulation for searching
-turn on and off parts which are maybe related to this error
-take a break or do something else for a while -
-again go througt the mentioned steps above


-write down what is the problem about, what is probably behind it

-trying to be angry
-trying to be desperate
-trying to laught that problem
-trying to be sad
-trying to be calm
-swear for a while
-put yourself to stres
-do not care, maybe it just need time
